I just finished my PhD in June 2023. It was a long journey for me but I finally managed to achieve it. I moved to the Netherlands the day after I defended my thesis and started my new life here. I already got my bike and look forward to meeting fun people and finding something new.

Again, thank you so much for those who have supported me over the last 6 years from all over the world. I won't forget my precious time in Budapest and Vienna. I will post some updates once I find out what to do next in this flat country.
