It has been two years since I moved to the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

I got another bike (cute Brompton!) so I have two bikes now. Very Dutch.

## Finished my integration (inburgering) and started a new job

FINALLY. Finally I completed my [integration (inburgering)](https://www.inburgeren.nl/en/integration-in-the-netherlands/) required to maintain my current residence permit and to apply for permanent residence in the future. Looking back on my life until the integration process was completed, it was not so bad, but it was really tough for me. It was painful to go to intensive language courses (4 days per week) and work part-time as a restaurant worker (also 3-4 days per week). However, it was good that I met "gezellige" colleagues and found [my favourite cafÃ©](https://thevillagecoffee.nl/) in Utrecht.

I got a new job with a Japanese company that sells automotive and air conditioning products and provides technical services.  The company has a European branch in the UK but they wanted to establish a new office in the Netherlands. Well, it is very different from what I have been doing but the job sounds exciting and I enjoy working with fun colleagues in different countries. I also like using multiple languages (Japanese and English at the moment, and Dutch in the future, hopelijk). I started the new position in May and have already gone on a business trip to the UK. It is also nice to have a stable income... ðŸ¤‘

## Our cat became one year old!

Our cat Tofu is now one year old. Fortunately, she has had no health issues. I am very happy to have her as part of our family. The only thing that I am worried lately is that she has started hunting mice and brings them home... But well, she is a cat after all. Other than that, she eats well and sleeps well. My life has changed a lot since I started living with her, in a good way. Dankjewel, Tofu.

## Some travel plans

Last year, we went to the UK (Wales) and Japan. I wrote about my trip to Kochi [here](https://atsukotominaga.com/2025/04/08/writing/080425/).

This year, we are going to Austria for our summer vacation (actually, in a few days). This time, we will visit Switzerland on the way back from Austria to the Netherlands and meet our friend in Wallis. We also hope to visit Japan again at some point next year. Probably around September. We may skip bigger cities like Tokyo and Osaka and are planning to visit new places like Hiroshima. Anyway, I need to save up money ðŸ’¸
