It has been my dream for a long time to live with a cat but it never came true because of my life style. Finally I settled down in the Netherlands and was lucky to have a chance to adopt a kitten from our neighbour.

Her name is Tofu. She was born at the end of March 2024. Her mom is our neighbour's cat. She had 5 kittens and one of them is Tofu.

This is when Tofu was roughly 6-week old. Just before we adopted her. We could see her regularly at our neighbour's.

She settled down in our house (well, just next to our neighbour's house though). She loves sleeping on IKEA blåhajs.

Of course Tofu could see her mom regularly. She still needed her mom (but not anymore, when I am writing this blog...).

She was too small to climb anything but as she grew up, she became able to climb chairs. She started doing a bit naughty things to me, like disturbing my typing for example.

She found out that it's warm on my laptop (keyboard) then started sleeping there often.

But she still likes sleeping on IKEA blåhajs too.

She settled in your house gradually.

Also, she started sleeping on my lap too. So adorable!

Sometimes we lost her and found her somewhere like in a random basket.

Now she is growing up very fast! I hope she likes living with us.
