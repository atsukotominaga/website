## RESEARCH INTEREST
I am interested in how learning from/with others has contributed to delivering cultural knowledge and skills to younger generations. I use an experimental method adapted from Cognitive Psychology and focus on the interaction between experts and novices in musical skill acquisition. I am currently working on how expert pianists modulate their performance to teach musical expressive techniques and how such modulations could be percieved by learners. I also use qualitative methods to complement my experimental work and have an experience in conducting and analysing inteview data.
